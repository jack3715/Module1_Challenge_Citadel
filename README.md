### Example of Technologies used at Citadel

The SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) settled with Citadel over concerns related to the operation of two of Citadel's trading algorithms, **FastFill** and **SmartProvide**. The settlement stemmed from the SEC's investigation into whether these algorithms took advantage of price differences between the official market data (provided by the designated Security Information Processor, SIP) and faster, more detailed data from stock exchanges themselves. The problem is that these programs were making decisions based on the differences between these two sources. This is sometimes called "latency arbitrage."

What makes this a big deal is that some people said these types of strategies couldn't really make much money, and there was a study from Berkeley that said so. This settlement with Citadel shows that these strategies were actually used, and they did make a difference. The settlement likely occurred as a resolution to the investigation, where Citadel agreed to specific terms and conditions without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.
